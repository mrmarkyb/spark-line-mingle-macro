spark line mingle macro
---------------------------------
This macro downloads 3rd party java-script to use the jquery support for downloads.
It is a very light wrapper around JQuery sparklines found at http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/ for more details on available 'options' values refer to this api.
note: This macro has an adapted rake deployment, to allow javascript files to be placed in mingles public folder and be accessible from the browser 

*macro attributes*
The query is a standard MQL query specifying project values to be used.
The options specify how the sparkline should be drawn, refer to http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/ for usage.
The target specifies the id of the html element to be enhanced with a sparkline. If no element exists with this id a span with this id is created inline and populated. Can be used in conjunction with the 'composite: true' option to plot multiple lines on a graph

example usages, see mingle macro documentation for deployment instructions.
